# Experiment
 
Each of the solutions have been run 100 times to compare the runtime of the different solutions.
Note that the Scala implementation is different from the other languages.

|Language|average runtime (ms)|
|--------|-------------------:|
|Node.js|1022|
|Java|957|
|Java parallelStream|756|
|Scala TriangularFactors|6197|
|Crystal|221|
|Python numba|909|
